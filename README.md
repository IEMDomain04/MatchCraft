# MatchCraft: Matching Card Game
Laboratory Activity: Applications Development and Emerging Technology

## 3 Different Game Modes
- **Quickest Time:** Test how quickly you can match the cards.
- **Countdown:** Match all the cards before the timer runs out!
- **Items | Mobs | Blocks:** Are you a Minecraft fan? Try this mode! Itâ€™s a unique twist without direct matches, can you complete it?

> [!NOTE]
> Integrated with a Firebase database, this game also features a global leaderboard. Players can add their names and see their ranks as they play.
